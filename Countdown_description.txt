Countdown
---------

Countdown is a program that counts days, months and years to a start of an event. User can add events, remove events 
and view all events with countdown timers. Event date can be in future or past (just for fun). Events and their 
start dates are saved to configuration file so that countdowns can be started again when program is restarted.

Following is the start of the program:
